# 100 analysis challange

#### Idea
Basic idea was to perform 1 analysis a day to develop DS/ML skills, a better one in compare to previous. Each day:
- new analysis
- new dataset, and it's organic aquisition
- new analysis techniques

Turns out, it's quite challanging indeed. For now project is in sleep mode. I add some analysis time to time with no pressure.

I will definitly back to it.

#### Inside 
Each analysis touches new data/problem and/or ways to solve it, also i try to keep the comments, graphs and problem descriptions in check.

#### Libraries:
Python3: pandas, nltk, spacy, sklearn, keras, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, more.
